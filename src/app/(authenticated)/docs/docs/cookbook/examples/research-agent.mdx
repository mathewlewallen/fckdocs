Learn how to build a research agent that combines ScrapeGraph's extraction capabilities with Tavily's search API to gather and analyze news articles on specific topics.

## The Goal

We'll extract the following information from news articles:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Title | Article headline |
| Link | URL to the article |
| Description | Article summary |

## Code Example

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

# Schema for a single news item
class NewsItemSchema(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="Title of the news article")
    link: str = Field(description="URL to the news article")
    description: str = Field(description="Summary/description of the news article")

# Schema that contains a list of news items
class ListNewsSchema(BaseModel):
    news: List[NewsItemSchema] = Field(description="List of news articles with their details")

# Agent implementation...
# 1. Uses Tavily to search for relevant articles
# 2. Extracts structured data using ScrapeGraph
# 3. Returns formatted news list
```
