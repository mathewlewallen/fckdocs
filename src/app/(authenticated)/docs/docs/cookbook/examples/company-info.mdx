## The Goal

We'll extract the following company information:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Company Name | Name of the company |
| Description | Brief description of the company |
| Founders | List of founders with their roles and LinkedIn profiles |
| Logo | Company logo URL |
| Partners | List of company partners |
| Pricing Plans | Details of available pricing tiers |
| Contact Emails | Company contact information |
| Social Links | LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub profiles |
| Legal | Privacy policy and terms of service URLs |
| API Status | Status page URL |

## Code Example

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from scrapegraph_py import Client

# Schema for founder information
class FounderSchema(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Name of the founder")
    role: str = Field(description="Role of the founder in the company")
    linkedin: str = Field(description="LinkedIn profile of the founder")

# Schema for pricing plans
class PricingPlanSchema(BaseModel):
    tier: str = Field(description="Name of the pricing tier")
    price: str = Field(description="Price of the plan")
    credits: int = Field(description="Number of credits included in the plan")

# Schema for social links

    linkedin: str = Field(description="LinkedIn page of the company")
    twitter: str = Field(description="Twitter page of the company")
    github: str = Field(description="GitHub page of the company")

    founders: List[FounderSchema] = Field(description="List of company founders")
    logo: str = Field(description="Logo URL of the company")
    partners: List[str] = Field(description="List of company partners")
    pricing_plans: List[PricingPlanSchema] = Field(description="Details of pricing plans")
    contact_emails: List[str] = Field(description="Contact emails of the company")
    social_links: SocialLinksSchema = Field(description="Social links of the company")
    privacy_policy: str = Field(description="URL to the privacy policy")
    terms_of_service: str = Field(description="URL to the terms of service")
    api_status: str = Field(description="API status page URL")

client = Client(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.smartscraper(
