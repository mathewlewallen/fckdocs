## The Goal

We'll extract the following article information:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Category | Article category (e.g., 'Health', 'Environment') |
| Title | Article headline |
| Link | URL to the full article |
| Author | Writer's name |

## Code Example

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List
from scrapegraph_py import Client

# Schema for a single news item
class NewsItemSchema(BaseModel):
    category: str = Field(description="Category of the news (e.g., 'Health', 'Environment')")
    title: str = Field(description="Title of the news article")
    link: str = Field(description="URL to the news article")
    author: str = Field(description="Author of the news article")

# Schema that contains a list of news items
class ListNewsSchema(BaseModel):
    news: List[NewsItemSchema] = Field(description="List of news articles with their details")

client = Client(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.smartscraper(
    website_url="https://www.wired.com/",
    user_prompt="Extract latest news articles",
    output_schema=ListNewsSchema
)
```

## Example Output

```json
{
    "news": [
        {
            "category": "Artificial Intelligence",
            "title": "The Race to Build Better Large Language Models",
